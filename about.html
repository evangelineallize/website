			<p class="about_text">			
			I was born in France in 1998. <br/>
			Later on I studied Philosophy, loved it. </br>
			Now I write, draw&paint, practice thai boxing </br>
			and try to be a good person. Most days.


			<!--I completed a degree in <a class="about_links" href="https://www.mcgill.ca" target="blank"> <u>McGill University</u></a> (Montreal, Canada),  majoring in Philosophy and minoring in Music and Economics. I am currently studying illustration at the Beaux-Arts Academy of Brussels. <br/><br/>
			These past five years, I have participated in several exhibitions: a personal exhibition (June 2016) donating the profits to Solidarité Enfance Roumanie (French NGO), Franc-Jeu <i class="italicabout">Le Misanthrope &nbsp</i>(October 2016), DoJo (November 2018), Live Art session for Opportutoring (February 2018), Oxfam Québec (November 2019), Micro-Ouvert by Franc-Jeu/OFM McGill (October 2016, November 2019).
			<br/><br/>
			My artistic engagement revolves around transdisciplinary activities, such as theatre, edition, comic writing, or journalism. For two years (2017-2018) I was the artistic director of Franc-Jeu, the francophone theatre company of McGill University. My role was to make set designs, posters, write and perform live music in two of the plays. During an internship at the French publishing house Pocket Jeunesse (May-August 2018) I got engaged with the world of children’s book publishing, evaluating texts sent to publication, reviewing comic books layouts, writing cover instructions and back cover summaries.  
			<br/><br/> My previous tenure at the Délit as Culture Editor led me to engage with the Montreal art scene, interviewing artists, reporting on exhibitions and cultural events in Montreal in addition to making creation booklets to promote the work of amateur artists. -->
